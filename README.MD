Invoice Application
===================

Simple .NET MVC5 and angularJS application
------------------------------------------

This app creates "users" and generates invoices using mvc design style. 

It uses json files as the db.  It is purely demo purposes only as there are a lot of 
features missing.


### Issues with the code

* little input validation 
* api accesses db directly, no business layer or DAO/layers
* objects could use a bit of work
* I just put this together in an afternoon.
